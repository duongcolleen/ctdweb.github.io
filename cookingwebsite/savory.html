                                <li>Divide ground chuck into 4 equal portions; form into patties.</li>
                                <li>Fry patties in skillet until beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove patties to a plate, retaining drippings in the skillet.</li>
                                <li>Stir onion and water into the reserved drippings. Reduce heat to low and cook until the onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir mushrooms into the onion mixture; cook until mushrooms are cooked through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
                                <li>Pour gravy over the onion and mushroom mixture; stir. Cook until the gravy is hot, about 5 minutes. Gently lie patties into the gravy; simmer until reheated through.</li>
                                <li>While the patties simmer in gravy, prepare a separate skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Fry eggs in the hot skillet until the white is opaque but the yolk remains runny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Divide rice between 4 plates. Top each rice portion with a beef patty and top the patties each with an egg. Pour gravy equally over each portion.</li>

                        Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish.

                                * For the rice they suggest day old rice. I usually cook mine in the morning or night before and refrigerate. It will still taste great if you are not able to do this.

                                <li>Wash the raw rice grains fist. Fill a pot with the rice and cold water to cover. Use your hands to swish the rice grains, loosening any extra starch and dirt. Rice (like beans) is a raw ingredient and it is important to wash and rinse! Washing also rids the rice of extra starch, which will give us light, fluffy, airy rice - not heavy, sticky and starchy. Tip the pot and carefully pour out the water. Repeat two more times. Drain as much water as possible from the pot. </li>
                                <li>Measure and add in the 2 3/4 cups of water. Snuggle the sausage in the rice grains. Turn the heat to high. When the water near the edge of the pot starts bubbling, cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 18 minutes. Note: While the rice is cooking, make the Sweet Soy Sauce.</li>
                                <li>When the rice is finished cooking, turn off heat and keep covered - no peeking! Let it sit with the lid on for 5 minutes to finish the steaming process.</li>
                                <li>Remove the sausages (careful, they are hot!) and slice them on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Arrange the sausages on top of the rice and drizzle the Sweet Soy Sauce on top. Serve extra Sweet Soy Sauce at the table for drizzling.</li>

Dissolve 1/4 cup cornstarch into 1/2 cup of water, and stir into boiling sauce. Simmer until the sauce thickens and turns clear, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and keep sauce warm.</li>
                                <li>Heat olive oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to a temperature of 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                                <li>Drop in the battered chicken pieces, a few at a time, and fry until they turn golden brown and float to the top of the oil, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel lined plate. To serve, place fried chicken pieces onto a serving platter, and pour the hot sauce overtop. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds to garnish.</li>

                                <li>Combine the chicken tenders with all of the marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag. Seal the bag tightly and smush it around to ensure chicken tenders are evenly coated with buttermilk and seasoning. Place in a bowl (in case of leakage) and refrigerate overnight, or at least 4 hours. </li>
                                <li>Make the breading by combining the flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and baking powder in a large bowl. Whisk until well combined, then add the buttermilk and stir with a fork until mixture is evenly clumpy.</li>
                                <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Remove the chicken tenders from the marinade a few at a time and toss into the flour mixture. Be sure to press the chicken firmly into the breading so clumps adhere to the meat. (It's best to use one hand to remove the tenders from the bag and the other to toss in the breading.) Set breaded tenders on prepared baking sheet.</li>
                                <li>Line another baking sheet with a few layers of paper towels and set aside. Add oil to a large, high-sided pot until the level reaches about 3/4-inch. Heat over high heat until oil is shimmering. (If a cube of bread sizzles when you drop it in, it's ready.) Using tongs, place several chicken tenders in the hot oil without crowding the pan. Cook until golden brown on the bottom side, a few minutes, then flip and cook until second side is also golden, a few minutes more. Set cooked tenders on baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Fry remaining tenders in batches. Serve hot.</li>
