                        Authentic Hawaiian macaroni salad is delicious.  In its simplicity, it has achieved something near perfection. That wonderful scoop of creamy pasta is amazing without a dense amount of extra ingredients. Hard to come by unless you're actually in Hawaii, but oh so good.

                                <li>Place a wire cooling rack or grill grate directly over the flame of a gas burner set on high. Place onions and ginger on top and cook, turning occasionally, until deeply blackened on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Alternatively, Adjust rack to 3 to 4 inches from broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Place onions and ginger on a foil-lined broiler tray. Broil, turning occasionally, until charred on all surfaces, about 25 minutes total. Set aside.</li>
                                <li>Meanwhile, combine beef shins, oxtail, chuck, and brisket in a large stockpot. Cover with cool water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 15 minutes, then dump water and meat into sink. When cool enough to handle, rince parts under cool running tap water, carefully scrubbing debris from off of any bones and out of cracks in the meat, then return them to the pot. Cover with cool water.</li>
                                <li>Add charred onions, ginger, anise, cinnamon, fennel, cloves, coriander, fish sauce, sugar, and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, skimming occasionally, until brisket and chuck are tender but not falling apart, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer brisket and chuck to a small bowl and cover with cold water. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
                                <li>Continue simmering broth for a further 4 hours, topping up with water as necessary. Strain broth through a fine mesh strainer. If desired, pick meat and connective tissue from oxtails and beef shins. Discard bones and aromatics. You should end up with about 4 quarts broth. Dilute with water or reduce as necessary to reach 4 quarts. Keep hot.</li>
                                <li>Carefully skim fat off of surface of broth and discard. Season broth to taste with additional fish sauce, salt, and/or sugar. It should be highly seasoned. Slice cooked beef into thin slices or rough chunks.</li>
                                <li>Prepare pho noodles according to package directions. To serve, place re-hydrated noodles in individual noodle bowls. Pour hot broth over noodles. Serve immediately, allowing guests to top with cooked meat and slices of raw flank steak, herbs, aromatics, lime, and sauce as they wish.</li>

When I go home during the breaks I always make sure to at least eat a couple bowls of pho because it is always a must. I don't eat it with siracha though because I cannot handle spicy foods, but I do love eating the bean sprouts with hoison sauce like french fries and ketchup."

                                <li>To begin, soak the dried mushrooms and vermicelli noodles in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain, rinse and squeeze out excess water. Chop into small segments and set aside.</li>
                                <li>Thaw out the wrappers. Then separate them into individually sheets. Be patient and pull apart each sheet slowly to prevent tearing.</li>
                                <li>Mix together the ground pork, chopped mushrooms and vermicelli noodles, green onions, white onion, sugar, pepper, salt and oyster sauce.</li>
                                <li>Begin assembling</li>
                                <li>In a pot, bring vegetable oil to a temperature of 325 F degrees. If you don't have thermometer, you can test the temperature by dropping a small piece of the wrapper into the oil. If it starts sizzling with bubbles around the wrapper, then it's ready. If it immediately burns the wrapper, then it's too hot so lower the temperature.</li>
                                <li>Cooking in small batches, deep fry the egg rolls for 5-10 minutes. The cooking time will vary depending on the size of your egg rolls. If it's on the small side, it will require less cooking time. If it's on the big size, it will require a bit more cooking time. </li>
                                <li><b>Helpful Cooking Tip</b>: Remove the egg rolls from the oil before it gets to the desired shade of brown. Residual cooking will continue to brown the egg rolls after they are removed from the oil. I always remove the egg rolls when it's a very light brown.</li>
                                <li>Remove the egg rolls from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper-lined plate.</li>
                                <li>Serve with the prepared fish sauce as a dipping sauce. You can eat the egg rolls by itself or wrapped with lettuce and assorted Vietnamese herbs such as sorrel (rau chua), fish mint (diep ca), Vietnamese coriander (rau ram), and perilla (tia to).</li>
